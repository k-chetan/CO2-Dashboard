Project Goal:
	To build a multi-page data narrative application that tells ten insightful stories about global CO emissions, 
	demonstrating end-to-end data engineering best practices and sophisticated analytical storytelling skills.


Target Audience
	Primary: Hiring managers and technical recruiters at data-driven companies.
	Secondary: Myself, as a learning tool and a reusable template for future data applications.
	Tertiary: The general public, as an accessible tool for exploring and understanding global emissions data.


Ten Key Analytical Stories:
	This application is structured with the purpose to answer following 10 analytical questions.
	Each question corresponding to a dedicated page in the dashboard:
	- Historical Responsibility: Who holds the most historical responsibility for cumulative CO emissions?
	- Personal Footprint: How does the personal carbon footprint of an individual differ across the globe today?
	- The Global Trend: What is the overarching global trend of total CO emissions over the last century?
	- Today's Heavy Hitters: Who are the biggest annual emitters today, and how has that changed since 1990?
	- The Great Acceleration: How did the industrial rise of nations like China reshape the global emissions landscape in the 21st century?
	- The Fuel Mix: What is the mix of fuels (coal, oil, gas) driving emissions in key countries, and how has it evolved?
	- Volatility & Shocks: How have major global crises and economic shocks impacted emissions growth year-over-year?
	- The Hope Story: Is there hope? Can economies achieve GDP growth while "decoupling" from their CO emissions?
	- Consumption vs. Production: What is the hidden impact of international trade on national emissions tallies?
	- The Analyst's View: What is the complex relationship between a nation's wealth, population, and emissions when viewed simultaneously?

Further Research Ideas:
	- Predictive Modeling: Investigate the feasibility of using time-series models (like ARIMA or Prophet) to generate near-term emissions forecasts for key nations, transitioning the dashboard from purely historical analysis to a forward-looking tool.
	- Interactive "What-If" Scenarios: Introduce interactive controls allowing users to model hypothetical scenarios, such as the impact of a 10% reduction in coal consumption in a specific country.
 	- Data Enrichment: Integrate alternative datasets, such as renewable energy production or carbon pricing policies, to explore potential causal relationships and add deeper context to the emissions data.
